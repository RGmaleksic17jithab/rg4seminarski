				<p>Still not sure whether or not you’d like to pay us a visit? Hopefully, after taking a look at these fantastic reviews from some of our best customers, you’ll be reassured.<br /><br />

					<p> Their array of cheese is very high quality and very diverse. Some of the meals were a bit out of my price range, but overall a mostly enjoyable experience.</p>

					<p> The quantity of cheese may be overwhelming at first, but I assure you they keep it at a tasteful amount. Wonderful service too, I’d recommend this place to anyone.</p>

					<p> Me and my boys had fantastic outings here. No meal on the menu I wouldn’t recommend, and the atmosphere is brilliant. Only complaint I have is that the waitresses mistook me for a mouse on several occasions, but the formal complaints were professionally handled. </p>

					<p> This restaurant’s a force of nature! Does anyone think they can walk past one and resist the urge to come in and try at least the baked brie? Now there’s a pretty meme! Exquisite!</p>
